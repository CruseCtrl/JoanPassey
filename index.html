      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Corpses, Coasts, and Carriages: Identifying a Cornish Gothic, 1840-1914</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I am a PhD researcher in English between the universities of Exeter, Cornwall Campus and Bristol, fully funded by the South, West and Wales Doctoral Training Partnership. My thesis, entitled “Corpses, Coasts, and Carriages: Identifying a Cornish Gothic Tradition, 1840-1914”, looks at the Gothicisation of Cornwall and the Cornish in novels, plays, poems, travel writing, and periodicals across the long nineteenth century, and what this can tell us about the place of Cornwall in the popular imagination, the construction of a Gothic canon, and the function of regionality in literature more generally.

I completed my M.St. in Literature 1700-1830 at Oriel College, University of Oxford in 2015 with a thesis on the sonic Gothic in the novels of Ann Radcliffe. Other research projects included erotic object narratives, eighteenth-century Egyptomania, and women bibliomaniacs. I finished my undergraduate degree at the University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus in 2014, with an undergraduate thesis on Gothic Cornwall in Sabine Baring-Gould’s In the Roar of the Sea, and was awarded the Dean’s Commendation for extraordinary academic achievement, the Community Award for engagement with the local and student community, and the Daniel Palmer Award for extraordinary contribution to student and community life. 

Other research interests include Gothic fiction from the eighteenth century to the present day, the history of science, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century travel writing, the blue humanities, psychogeography, dark/gothic/thano tourism, object oriented ontology and material cultures, and the representation of the auditory in literature, as well as works by Shirley Jackson, Margaret Atwood, and Bret Easton Ellis. A particular interest is in recovering lost women’s fiction, and in period drama on the big and small screens.

I am currently one of the postgraduate representatives for the Centre for Victorian Studies at the University of Exeter. I am a peer reviewer for the Wilkie Collins journal and the Fantastika journal, and a member of the Embodiment, Figures in the Landscape, and The Perspective from the Sea research clusters. Outside of academia, I’m an amateur potter, and love running, swimming, cooking, and reading books that have nothing to do with my subject. I’m currently in my third year of research, and look forward to continuing to develop as a researcher, writer, and teacher. Goals for the year include learning to fly a hot air balloon and making a set of egg cups.
